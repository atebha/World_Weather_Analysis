# World_Weather_Analysis

Purpose:

  Using python code, pandas and API's to perform an analysis of world vacation destinations based on weather, particularly the temperature range at a destination. Python code and the pandas libarary was used to perform an analysis of vacation destinations around the world based on user input minimum and maximum temperature. Using APIs, city locations, based on latitude and longitude coordinates, and nearest hotels to those city locations were found.

Analysis: 

  Starting the analysis, a set of 2000 random latitudes and longitudes coordinates were generated to get the nearest city using an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. This call found XXX cities. Based on that city list, input statements were created to retrieve potential travel destinations based on the user's criteria and nearby hotels based on the nearest cities that were called by the API filtered by the given temperature range inputted by the user. In this case 65-120Â°F.
